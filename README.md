# Lance

**Lance** is a lightweight game engine designed for myself and a small group (?) that doesn't like scripting or using bloated editors. It’s tailored to be **multiplayer-focused**.

> ⚠️ Warning: This project is in early development.

## Features
- Focused on coding, not scripting (X language or whatever, maybe? will need to think about it)  
- Lightweight and minimalistic  
- Easy to integrate with your projects (well… mostly)

## TODO
- [ ] Recode to SDL
- [ ] Add Camera
- [ ] Add Model Loading
- [ ] Add Bullet Physics
- [ ] Add Sound Engine
- [ ] Improve basic ECS
- [ ] Improve Rendering
- [ ] Add more complicated rendering
- [ ] Improve Code Consistency
- [ ] Declutter the Workspace
- [ ] Refactor some things (hopefully not the entire engine)
- [ ] Netcode

## Notes
- Currently under heavy development  
- Expect frequent breaking changes  
- Beware of ChatGPT spam; I can't care, I am tired  
- The included game is just an example of what you can do with it. My goal is to eventually make a multiplayer (?) voxel game
